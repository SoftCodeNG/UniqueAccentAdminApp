                      SPEAKING IS DIFFERENT FROM COMMUNICATION, You can Speak without
                      communicating and this is what many people do not understand. A lot of
                      People think that speaking with good diction is about faking an accent or
                      rolling your tongue, NO! It is never about rolling your tongue or faking an
                      accent, It is about accurate and effective communication such that anyone
                      from any part of the world can understand you clearly. This is what a lot of
